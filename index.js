  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  this.isFlying = false;
}
Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

/* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Default Binding (In the global execution context , this refers to the global object 'window').
    2. Implicit Binding (Inside a function, the value of this depends on the calle).
    3. Explicit Binding (In this case, you can force a function call to use a particular object
       for this using functions such as call, apply and bind).
    4. New Binding (when we use new keyword, an empty object is created and referenced by this variable, inheriting the prototype of the function)
